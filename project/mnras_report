%
% v3.0 May 2015
%    Renamed to match the new package name
%    Version number matches mnras.cls
%    A few minor tweaks to wording
% v1.0 September 2013
%    Beta testing only - never publicly released
%    First version: a simple (ish) template for creating an MNRAS paper


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[ceqn,usenatbib]{mnras}
% fleqn aligns equations to the left.
% to centre align replace fleqn with ceqn.


% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}


% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{ae,aecompl}


%%%%% AUTHORS - PLACE YOUR OWN PACKAGES HERE %%%%%

% Only include extra packages if you really need them. Common packages are:
\usepackage{graphicx}	% Including figure files
\graphicspath{ {../images/} }   % [added by JP - home, then down 1 level]

\usepackage{amsmath}	% Advanced maths commands
\usepackage{amssymb}	% Extra maths symbols

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%% AUTHORS - PLACE YOUR OWN COMMANDS HERE %%%%%

% Please keep new commands to a minimum, and use \newcommand not \def to avoid
% overwriting existing commands. Example:
\newcommand{\fluxdensity}{\,W m$^{-2}$}	% watts per square meter.
\newcommand{\Mpc}{\,Mpc}	% Mega parsecs.
\newcommand{\Lsun}{\,$L_{\sun}$}	% Solar luminosity.
\newcommand{\Msun}{\,$M_{\sun}$}	% Solar mass.
\newcommand{\kms}{\,km s$^{-1}$}	% kilometres per second.
\newcommand{\ms}{\,m s$^{-1}$}	    % metres per second.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
The abstract should briefly describe the aims, methods, and main results of the paper.
It should be a single paragraph not more than 250 words (200 words for Letters).
No references should appear in the abstract.

I am hopeful that the project list will be available soon, then I can go to work on it. Maybe this paper will be accepted!
\end{abstract}

% Select between one and six entries from the list of approved keywords.
% Don't make up new ones.
\begin{keywords}
keyword1 beauty -- keyword2 charm -- keyword3 garbage
\end{keywords}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   TOC   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The MNRAS class isn't designed to include a table of contents, but for this document one is useful.
% I therefore have to do some kludging to make it work without masses of blank space.

\section{Weighted Least Squares (WLS) linear fits}

In this section we present plots showing the weighted least squares (WLS) least squares linear fit line to the RT trace plots. The weighting method used is $w = 1/\epsilon^2$ where $w$ represents the weight applied to an error bar, and $\epsilon$ represents the magnitude of the error.
